This thesis develops an empirically validated tool for programming classes at high school level which allows students to experience and explore interactively various abstraction layers involved in running a program.

Didactic literature suggests that exploring different abstraction layers (called \emph{Sichtenwechsel}) improves students' understanding of both programming and the inner workings of a computer system. Such multi-layered exploration is even considered a foundational idea of computer science and has to be taught, among others because many lower abstraction layers tend to leak through interfaces anyways.

On the basis of the Smalltalk environment ``Glamorous Toolkit'', an interpreter for the Processing programming language in its Python form was developed and molded with many different views: Tokenization, syntax tree building, transpilation of Processing into Smalltalk, translation to an intermediary language and eventually into Smalltalk bytecode and finally the program's actual output. These views are tied to source code and updated live for seamless exploration and can be composed in interactive teaching material.

This product has been used for various lessons for which both plans and a brief evaluation is included. The evaluation shows on very limited data that the live environment does encourage experimentation and allows for students to work at their own speed and depth, allowing them to profit at their pace. Understanding of the various layers has however not improved significantly in the short period of time the tool could be tested.\footnote{A typographical note:
