\chapter{Installing and Using \texttt{Processing Abstractions}} \label{app_setup}

In order to set up \texttt{Processing Abstractions}, first download Glamorous Toolkit from \url{https://gtoolkit.com/download/} for your platform and extract the archive's entire content.

Before running it, create a new text file called \texttt{startup.st} in GT's top-level folder besides \ct{GlamorousToolkit.image} with the following content (access it through figure \ref{fig_startup_st_qr}):

\begin{code}
Metacello new
	repository: 'github://zeniko/gt-exploration:main/src';
	baseline: 'GtExploration';
	load.

Metacello new
	repository: 'github://zeniko/processing-abstractions:main/src';
	baseline: 'ProcessingAbstractions';
	load.

"Hide the 'Implementation and Tests' section."
GtExplorationHomeSection studentMode: true.

"Make indenting keyboard shortcuts available to non-US-English keyboard layouts
(cf. https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/3002)."
LeSnippetElement keyboardShortcuts
	at: #IndentSnippet
		put: BlKeyCombinationBuilder new alt shift arrowRight build;
	at: #UnindentSnippet
		put: BlKeyCombinationBuilder new alt shift arrowLeft build.

"Make the zoom in keyboard shortcut available to de-CH keyboard layouts
(cf. https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/4624)."
TLeWithFontSize compile:
	((TLeWithFontSize methodNamed: #initializeFontSizeShortcuts) sourceCode
		copyReplaceAll: 'equal' with: 'shift minus').

"Patch unneeded addressbar out of YouTube snippet
(cf. https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/4560)."
LeYoutubeReferenceElement compile:
	((LeYoutubeReferenceElement methodNamed: #updatePicture) sourceCode
		copyReplaceAll: '</iframe>'' ' with: '</iframe>''; removeChildAt: 1 ').
\end{code}

Finally run the \texttt{GlamorousToolkit} executable (under Windows and Linux it's located in the \ct{bin} subfolder). The content of \texttt{Processing Abstractions} are now available behind the ``Unterrichtseinheiten'' home tile.

Verify that everything works as desired and then close and save the changes to the image. Now, the above \ct{startup.st} can be removed, since all its changes have been persisted in GT's \ct{.image} file.

\emph{Warning:} If you've already used GT before, the contents of your local knowledge database will also be included in GT's image. Therefore rename that folder (usually \ct{lepiter/default} in your documents folder) before starting the GT meant for distribution.

Also, since the executable \ct{GlamorousToolkit.exe} is located in a subdirectory under Windows and Linux, adding a top-level link can help students. See \url{https://github.com/zeniko/gtRunner} for a ready-to-use drop-in.

\chapter{GT Processing API} \label{app_api}

This appendix lists the available API calls implemented in Processing Abstraction's Processing. This has been auto-generated from GT page ``Processing API'':

	Clears the canvas and changes its color (see \ct{fill(gray)}). Default is light gray (192).

Paths can be absolute or relative to either \ct{FileLocator class>>gtResource} or:
\begin{code}
Element
GtInspector newOn: FileLocator documents / 'lepiter'
\end{code}
\item[\texttt{rect(x, y, width, height)}] \hfill \\

\item[\texttt{square(x, y, side)}] \hfill \\
	Draws a square with the given side length, parallel to the coordinate axes with its top left corner at \ct{(x; y)}. Short for \ct{rect(x, y, side, side)}.
\item[\texttt{text(string, x, y)}] \hfill \\
	Renders the given \ct{string} with its baseline starting at \ct{(x; y)}.
\item[\texttt{textSize(size)}] \hfill \\
	Sets the size for rendering text in pixels. Default is 12px.
\item[\texttt{triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)}] \hfill \\
	Draws a triangle with its vertices at the points \ct{(x1; y1)}, \ct{(x2; y2)} and \ct{(x3; y3)}.
