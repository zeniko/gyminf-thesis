%%%%% Conclusion and Future Work %%%%%

\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch_conclusion}

\begin{todo}
\item new teaching environment according to didactic recommended practice
\item various abstraction layers observable for the same program, at the same time, with live changes
\item works mostly with minor hiccups
\item students have been using it somewhat successfully
\item effects not (yet) measurable
\item future work required
\end{todo}


\section{Future Work} \label{sc_future}

\begin{todo}
\item better study
\item applying the same principle to other domains: natural sciences (cf. simulations, \eg ``Epidemien-Simulation''), psychology, languages, \etc
\item Things to implement
\begin{itemize}
\item fuller Processing API (although: manageability)
\item inner functions, functions as objects (mapping to callable objects)
\item objects (mapping to Smalltalk objects)
\item type checking (Python and Smalltalk are both strictly but dynamically typed)
\item Option to translate bytecode or intermediary code to other assembly syntaxes (Intel x86, LMA, WASM, \dots)
\item optimizer and views
\item animations, better visualizations
\end{itemize}
\item adaption for different languages (few changes required for Python, whatever's missing is also missing for Processing)
\end{todo}
