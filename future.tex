\section{Future Work} \label{sc_future}

\begin{todo}
\item Lack of first class functions (beyond code blocks): transpiling only known functions
\item No type checking (Python and Smalltalk are both strictly but dynamically typed)
\item Option to translate bytecode or intermediary code to other assembly syntaxes (Intel x86, LMA, WASM, \dots)
\end{todo}
