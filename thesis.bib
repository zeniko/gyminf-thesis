Das Buch besteht aus einem kompakten theoretischen Teil, gefolgt von vier Kapiteln mit zahlreichen Beispielen, die aus dem Unterricht entstanden und gut erprobt sind. Schulinformatik ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil einer zeitgem\"{a}\ss{}en Allgemeinbildung. Das technische Fach erm\"{o}glicht durch seine Inhalte, Methoden und Werkzeuge einen sch\"{u}leraktivierenden, produktorientierten Unterricht. Die Beispiele sollen einen Eindruck von diesem Vorgehen vermitteln. In ihrer Menge bilden sie eine Art Ideensammlung f\"{u}r kreativen Unterricht. Das Buch begr\"{u}ndet die Schulinformatik als allgemeinbildendes Fach, das durch sechs fundamentale Ideen gepr\"{a}gt ist. Aus diesen werden Kompetenzbereiche abgeleitet, die sich alters-, schul- und l\"{a}nderspezifisch konkretisieren lassen. In den folgenden Kapiteln werden die Themenbereiche der Schulinformatik den Oberthemen Informatik und Gesellschaft, informatischen Grundlagen, Programmieren und Methodik zugeordnet. Die Autoren beschreiben eine "Informatik f\"{u}r alle" und verwenden daf\"{u}r diverse Varianten grafischer Programmiersprachen. Die meisten Beispiele im Buch werden durch Skripte grafischer Sprachen erl\"{a}utert, die hier als Medium zur Verdeutlichung informatischer Konzepte dienen.},

The special issue connects earlier research on what K-12 students can learn and be able to do using CT with the CT skills and habits of mind needed to productively participate in professional CT-integrated STEM fields. In this context, the phrase ``disciplinary perspective'' simultaneously holds two meanings: it refers to and aims to make connections between established K-12 STEM subject areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and newer CT-integrated disciplines such as computational sciences. The special issue presents a framework for CT integration and includes articles that illuminate what CT looks like from a disciplinary perspective, the challenges inherent in integrating CT into K-12 STEM education, and new ways of measuring CT aligned more closely with disciplinary practices. The aim of this special issue is to offer research-based and practitioner-grounded insights into recent work in CT integration and provoke new ways of thinking about CT integration from researchers, practitioners, and research-practitioner partnerships.},

	abstract     = {Video games are an oft-cited reason for young learners getting interested in programming and computer science. As such, many learning opportunities build on this interest by having kids program their own video games. This approach, while sometimes successful, has its drawbacks stemming from the fact that the challenge of programming and game building are left distinct from the gameplay experience that initially drew learners in. An alternate strategy to engage learners in programming that builds on their interest and enjoyment of video games is to integrate programming into the gameplay experience directly through the design of program-to-play games. These games make programming a central part of the activity of playing the game, fully immersing programming within the game context. In this article, the authors develop the genre of program-to-play games, discuss key features of these environments and their pedagogical potential, and highlight some exemplar program-to-play games.}

Problem based learning activities were carried out in flipped classrooms to promote self-regulation. A total of 30 undergraduate students from Mechatronic department participated in the study. Self-regulation skills were discussed through students' and the instructor's experiences including their opinions and behaviours. Qualitative data was collected with an observation form, discussion messages and interviews with selected participants. As a result, in terms of self-regulated learning, the goal setting and planning, task strategies and help seeking skills of the students were high in the face to face learning designed with problem based activities through flipped classroom model, their goal setting and planning, task strategies and help seeking skills were appeared moderately. In the home sessions, environment structuring, goal setting and planning skills were developed in high level while task strategies, help seeking, time management, monitoring, self-efficacy and self-evaluation skills were moderate and monitoring skills was lower. Consequently, it is hoped that the study may provide some suggestions for using problem based activities in flipped learning.}

When designers and artists learn the basics of writing software, they develop a new form of literacy that enables them to create new media for the present, and to imagine future media that are beyond the capacities of current software tools. This book introduces this new literacy by teaching computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity. Written by Processing's cofounders, the book offers a definitive reference for students and professionals. Tutorial chapters make up the bulk of the book; advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and installation are discussed in interviews with their creators.This second edition has been thoroughly updated. It is the first book to offer in-depth coverage of Processing 2.0 and 3.0, and all examples have been updated for the new syntax. Every chapter has been revised, and new chapters introduce new ways to work with data and geometry. New "synthesis" chapters offer discussion and worked examples of such topics as sketching with code, modularity, and algorithms. New interviews have been added that cover a wider range of projects. "Extension" chapters are now offered online so they can be updated to keep pace with technological developments in such fields as computer vision and electronics.InterviewsSUE.C, Larry Cuba, Mark Hansen, Lynn Hershman Leeson, J\"{u}rg Lehni, LettError, Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman, Benjamin Maus, Manfred Mohr, Ash Nehru, Josh On, Bob Sabiston, Jennifer Steinkamp, Jared Tarbell, Steph Thirion, Robert Winter},

This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university's educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.}

	abstract     = {About a decade ago there was a sharp increase in the number of research publications focusing on programming error messages. The majority of this work focused on improving or "enhancing'' compiler error messages to make them easier for humans, especially novice programmers, to interpret and use more effectively. Little research has been published on explicitly teaching students how to effectively utilize error messages, or leveraging programming error messages as learning opportunities. However, there is no shortage of research showing that error and warning messages present barriers to students learning to program. Additionally, unhelpful and/or unfriendly error messages can cause frustration and negative emotions. We operate on the premise that not utilizing programming error and warning messages effectively, or at all, increases the difficulty of learning to program, and the undesired effects that this is known to have. As compiler messages vary by programming language and/or development environment, both in message and presentation, lessons on interpreting them are not typically included in mainstream educational materials. We believe this gap can be filled and that students can learn to use error messages to their advantage. Further, we believe that teaching students how to read and use error messages can have a significant positive impact on the learning experience for novice programmers. This work presents research on teaching novice programmers how to use programming error messages. Reported here are results from (a) a global survey of computing instructors investigating teaching the use of error / warning messages to novice programmers, (b) a multi-national pilot survey of 345 students about their experience with and attitudes toward error messages, (c) a search for existing online resources created and used by computing faculty, as well as (d) results of an empirical study with 1061 student participants testing an example lesson on using programming language use. The data show our single class-period example lesson makes a difference in student attitude toward programming error messages and their ability to use the messages.},

	abstract     = {Programming has been considered the "essence of informatics" since the beginning of computing as a discipline. But programming in the fifties was very different from what we know today, and one of the goals (or dreams) throughout the history of programming language technology, has been "automatic programming''---the ability to automatically generate computer code starting from a high(er)-level description of the specification of that code. What this meant changed over the years, from punching paper tape, to compiling high-level programming languages, to program synthesis.Today, however, the availability of machine learning artefacts that produce high-level code from natural language specifications has completely changed the traditional meaning. To the extent that some computer scientists have begun to question the received wisdom that the core of their discipline is deeply rooted in programming.If programming and programming languages are no longer the essence of computer science, this changes the epistemology of the discipline itself. Moreover, if we are at the end of programming, we should also change the curriculum, where programming, algorithms and programming languages play a major role. Several recent papers reviewed the performance of code generators based on large language models on typical CS1 problems (e.g., from the many possible citations and how machine learning impacts K-12 teaching.Starting from this data, I will argue for the role of programming in the curriculum, distinguishing between programming taught as part of a holistic curriculum (as in some non-technical high schools) or as a vocational tool. I will use Simondon's notion of (closed and open) technical object as an interpretive lens, together with Calvino's reflections on the availability of writing machines capable of replacing the poet and the author.},

However, student excitement over graphical outputs is not a   guarantee of conceptual understanding of programming, and   graphics may even distract from intended learning outcomes.   Our contribution is twofold. First, we analyze a selection of   existing graphics libraries designed for novice programmers.   We consider how these libraries foster clean decomposition,   direct students' attention to key content, and manage complexity; we find shortcomings in these respects. These shortcomings involve the libraries' support for global coordinates  and external graphics, as well as their rich APIs; we argue   that these features, although powerful, are also potential   pitfalls in student learning. Second, we present the design of   a new graphics library, PyTamaro, which avoids the pitfalls   with a minimalist design that eschews coordinates; we also   outline a pedagogical approach that builds on PyTamaro's   strengths and deliberate limitations. We briefly discuss PyTamaro's trade-offs in comparison to coordinate-based libraries.   The work reported here paves the way for future empirical   evaluations of PyTamaro and associated teaching practices.},

Scholars believe that programming training could promote students\^{a}\mbox{\texteuro}{}\texttrademark{} higher order thinking performance; however, many school teachers have reported the difficulty of teaching programming courses.

In this study, an online peer assessment-based system was developed to cope with this problem. The students could use the peer-assessment function to provide comments to peers, and review the feedback and scores from peers during the learning activity. A quasi experiment was conducted on four classes of 166 ninth graders of a junior high school located in southern Taiwan to examine the impacts of the developed system. Two classes of students were assigned to the experimental group, learning with an online peer assessment-based teaching strategy, while the other two classes were the control group, learning with the conventional teaching strategy. The experimental results showed that the students in the experimental group had better programming knowledge and skills as well as more positive learning attitudes and critical thinking awareness than those in the control group, revealing the benefits of the proposed approach.}

	abstract     = {The block-based programming paradigm has gained popularity across various application areas, including programming education, physical computing, and creative arts and media. While initially targeting young learners, environments such as Scratch have demonstrated the versatility of this paradigm beyond its original audience. This paper explores the potential application of block-based code manipulation in the field of low-level programming, which is a fundamental component of many computer science curricula. However, existing visualization tools for teaching low-level computing do not leverage the benefits of block-based programming, such as eliminating the need to memorize syntax. This paper presents Blocksambler, a prototype of a block-based programming environment for teaching low-level computing. The purpose of this paper is two-fold, in the first theoretical part we explore the potential application of block-based code manipulation in the field of low-level programming, which is a fundamental component of many computer science curricula. In the second part, we introduce Blocksambler, a prototype of a block-based programming environment for teaching low-level computing. Blocksambler is built upon Blockly, a JavaScript library designed for creating customized block-based programming tools and for the purpose of teaching low-level computing. Reflecting the relevance, benefits, and limitations of Blocksambler for educational purposes, we conclude the discussion started in the first part of the paper and outline further steps.},

Strype is a new online editor which implements FBE's idea for Python and is used for programming the micro:bit. This demo will showcase the unique elements of Strype and demonstrate its use. This demo aims in introducing FBE and Strype to the educational community in order to generate fruitful discussions, get feedback and also promote its use to educational settings.},

	abstract     = {This article is a survey of program visualization systems intended for teaching beginners about the runtime behavior of computer programs. Our focus is on generic systems that are capable of illustrating many kinds of programs and behaviors. We inclusively describe such systems from the last three decades and review findings from their empirical evaluations. A comparable review on the topic does not previously exist; ours is intended to serve as a reference for the creators, evaluators, and users of educational program visualization systems. Moreover, we revisit the issue of learner engagement which has been identified as a potentially key factor in the success of educational software visualization and summarize what little is known about engagement in the context of the generic program visualization systems for beginners that we have reviewed; a proposed refinement of the frameworks previously used by computing education researchers to rank types of learner engagement is a side product of this effort. Overall, our review illustrates that program visualization systems for beginners are often short-lived research prototypes that support the user-controlled viewing of program animations; a recent trend is to support more engaging modes of user interaction. The results of evaluations largely support the use of program visualization in introductory programming education, but research to date is insufficient for drawing more nuanced conclusions with respect to learner engagement. On the basis of our review, we identify interesting questions to answer for future research in relation to themes such as engagement, the authenticity of learning tasks, cognitive load, and the integration of program visualization into introductory programming pedagogy.},

	abstract     = {Block-based programming systems, such as Scratch or Alice, are the most popular environments for introducing young children to programming. However, mastery of text-based programming continues to be the educational goal for students who continue to program into their teenage years and beyond. Transitioning across the significant gap between the two editing styles presents a difficult challenge in school-level teaching of programming. We propose a new style of program manipulation to bridge the gap: frame-based editing. Frame-based editing has the resistance to errors and approachability of block-based programming while retaining the flexibility and more conventional programming semantics of text-based programming languages. In this paper, we analyse the issues involved in the transition from blocks to text and argue that they can be overcome by using frame-based editing as an intermediate step. A design and implementation of a frame-based editor is provided.},
